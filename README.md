pushbullet-kde-servicemenu
==========================

A Kde4 service menu to send files with Pushbullet from Dolphin.

Installation
------------

- Copy pushbullet-kde to a bin directory (~/bin or /usr/local/bin) and make it executable (chmod +x pushbullet-kde)
- Copy pushbullet.png to ~/.kde/share/icon/
- Copy pushbullet.desktop to ~/.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/


Todo (in a far away future...)
